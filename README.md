# (T)he (R)replacement (W)as (M)odded

A small mod for [The Farmer Was Replaced](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced/)
with (subjective) QOL-improvements. Focuses on making the game easier to control with a keyboard by introducing a modal
system for most game actions. Also contains additional debugging/development features.

# Setup

## Installation
1. Download and install [Melonloader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README?id=automated-installation) for TFWR
2. Get the latest TRWM version from [releases](https://github.com/touchsoft-agroth/trwm/releases)
3. Put the .dll file into the melonloader mods directory (tfwr_install_dir/Mods)

## Manual game configuration
The mod uses the WASD keys for various functions. I recommend rebinding the camera movement keys
to the arrow keys. You will not need those with this mod installed.

## Important
The drone may appear to move very slow in drone mode. This is only a visual issue,
but can be resolved by running a proper script that moves the drone once. Still
unclear why this is needed, but fixing is not the highest priority.
